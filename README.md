# NYCU-DLP

# Lab1 - Backpropagation
In this lab, you will need to understand and implement simple neural networks with **forwarding pass** and **backpropagation** using two hidden layers.

# Lab2 - Butterfly & Moth Classification
In this lab, you will need to classify Butterfly or moths via the **VGGNet** and the **ResNet** architectures.

# Lab3 - Binary Semantic Segmentation
In this lab, you will focus on binary semantic segmentation using **ResNet34** and **UNet**, where the goal is to classify each image pixel as belonging to the foreground (object of interest) or the background.

# Lab 4 - Conditional VAE for Video Prediction
In this lab, you need to implement conditional video prediction in a **VAE-based model**.

# Lab5 - MaskGIT for Image Inpainting
In this lab, you will focus on implementing MaskGIT for the inpainting task via **multi-head attention**,**transformer** training, and inference inpainting.

# Lab6 - Generative Models
In this lab, you need to implement **GAN** and **DDPM** to generate synthetic images according to multi-label conditions: Given a specific set of label conditions.
